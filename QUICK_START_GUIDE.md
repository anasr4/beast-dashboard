---

## Step 5: Get Refresh Token (7 minutes)

**This is the most technical step - follow carefully:**

### A. Get Authorization Code

1. Copy this URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Client ID from Step 4):
   ```
   https://accounts.snapchat.com/login/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://localhost:8000/callback&scope=snapchat-marketing-api&state=test
   ```

2. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in the URL with your real Client ID
   - Example: If your Client ID is `abc123`, the URL becomes:
   ```
   https://accounts.snapchat.com/login/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=abc123&redirect_uri=https://localhost:8000/callback&scope=snapchat-marketing-api&state=test
   ```

3. Paste the URL in your browser and press Enter

4. Login to Snapchat if asked

5. Click **"Continue"** or **"Authorize"**

6. You'll be redirected to a page that says "Can't reach this page" - **THIS IS NORMAL!**

7. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. It will look like:
   ```
   https://localhost:8000/callback?code=LONG_CODE_HERE&state=test
   ```

8. Copy the part after `code=` and before `&state`
   - Example: If URL is `...?code=abc123xyz&state=...`, copy `abc123xyz`
   - ‚úÖ **Save this code** - this is your Authorization Code

### B. Exchange Code for Refresh Token

**You need to make an API call. Use one of these methods:**

#### Method 1: Use Postman (Recommended)

1. Download Postman: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
2. Install and open Postman
3. Click **"New"** ‚Üí **"HTTP Request"**
4. Set request type to **POST**
5. Enter URL: `https://accounts.snapchat.com/login/oauth2/access_token`
6. Click **"Body"** tab
7. Select **"x-www-form-urlencoded"**
8. Add these fields:

   | Key | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | `grant_type` | `authorization_code` |
   | `client_id` | Your Client ID from Step 4 |
   | `client_secret` | Your Client Secret from Step 4 |
   | `code` | Authorization Code from Step 5A |
   | `redirect_uri` | `https://localhost:8000/callback` |

9. Click **"Send"**
10. You'll get a response with `refresh_token`
11. ‚úÖ **Copy and save the `refresh_token`** - this is what you need!

#### Method 2: Use curl (Terminal/Command Prompt)

```bash
curl -X POST https://accounts.snapchat.com/login/oauth2/access_token \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTH_CODE" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://localhost:8000/callback"
```

Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET, and YOUR_AUTH_CODE with your values.

## Step 6: Get Ad Account ID (3 minutes)

1. Go to: https://ads.snapchat.com/
2. Look at the URL in your browser
3. You'll see something like:
   ```
   https://ads.snapchat.com/ads/accounts/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/dashboard
   ```
4. The long string after `/accounts/` is your Ad Account ID (format: UUID)
5. ‚úÖ **Copy and save your Ad Account ID**

---

## ‚úÖ Credentials Checklist

Before continuing, make sure you have saved:

- [ ] Client ID (from Step 4)

3. Click **"Create fork"**
4. Wait 10 seconds - your copy is being created
