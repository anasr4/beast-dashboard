Hey! I fixed the OAuth redirect URL issue. Now everyone can deploy their own bot on Railway and it works perfectly!

## What Changed?

The bot now **auto-detects** its own Railway URL, so OAuth works for every deployment.

# üéØ How to Set Up ANAS Beast Bot (30 minutes)

## Quick Setup:

1. **Deploy on Railway:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/anasr4/beast-dashboard
   - Fork the repo (click Fork button)
   - Deploy on Railway: https://railway.app
   - Connect your forked repo
   - Wait 5 minutes for deployment

2. **Get Your Railway URL:**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Generate Domain
   - You'll get: `https://beast-dashboard-production-xxxxx.up.railway.app`
   - **Copy this URL!**

3. **Create Snapchat App:**
   - Go to: https://business.snapchat.com/apps
   - Create new OAuth app
   - **IMPORTANT:** Set Redirect URL to:
     ```
     https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/api/oauth/callback
     ```
     Example: `https://beast-dashboard-production-12345.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback`
   - Get your Client ID and Client Secret

- **Railway Deployment:** [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](https://github.com/anasr4/beast-dashboard/blob/main/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

**The redirect URL in Snapchat MUST match your Railway URL exactly:**

‚úÖ Correct: `https://beast-dashboard-production-12345.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback`
‚ùå Wrong: `https://web-production-95efb.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback` (my URL)

Each Railway deployment gets its own unique URL. The bot auto-detects yours!

## üÜò If OAuth Doesn't Work:

1. Check redirect URL in Snapchat matches your Railway URL exactly
2. Must include `/api/oauth/callback` at the end
3. No trailing slash
4. Use `https://` not `http://`

See [OAUTH_SETUP.md](https://github.com/anasr4/beast-dashboard/blob/main/OAUTH_SETUP.md) for troubleshooting.

## ‚úÖ When It Works:

You'll be able to:
- Create 100s of ads in minutes
- Upload unlimited videos
- Exact ad count guarantee (request 100 = get 100)
- Auto-retry failed uploads
- Real-time progress tracking

## üí° Quick Answer to "What redirect URL do I use?"

**Use YOUR Railway URL, not mine!**

After you deploy on Railway, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://beast-dashboard-production-XXXXX.up.railway.app
```

Then set redirect URL in Snapchat to:
```
https://beast-dashboard-production-XXXXX.up.railway.app/api/oauth/callback
```

The bot auto-detects this URL, so OAuth will work perfectly for you!
